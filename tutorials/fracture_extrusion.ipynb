    "1. Create a 3D fracture network that is consistent with a flat 2d outcrop, in the sense that if the 3d network is cut at the outcrop height, the 2d network should be reproduced.\n",
    "2. Produce circular fracture planes, potentially cut, with a prescribed or random dip angle.\n",
    "3. Preserve Y/T-intersections, in the sense that if one fracture ends in another in the outcrop, this relation will be kept in the extruded network. However, fractures that meet outside the outcrop plane will not be cut in this way.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is missing \n",
    "1. A geological foundation for the way the extrusion is carried out. What is here so far is an attempt to apply common sense, but nothing more.\n",
    "2. Population of fractures that do not intersect with the outcrop plane. These will have to be assigned e.g. by stochatsic rules, but this is beyond the scope of PorePy.\n",
    "3. Extrusion to other than circular shapes.\n",

    "1. All extruded fractures will be circles, for lack of more information.\n",
    "2. The fractures are assumed to be cut at an arbitrary height relative to their center. In the extrusion, the z-coordinate of the center, thus the radius of the fracturce, is drawn as random numbers. The behavior can be overruled by the parameter 'extrusion_angle', which should be between 0 and $\\pi$. Note that the limiting cases define infinite fractures, while $\\pi/2$ will give a point contact in the outcrop plane, none of which are physical.\n",
    "3. Depending on the fracture radius, the above procedure may yield a T-intersection where the terminated fracture extends beyond the constraining fracture. To avoid this, the size of the constraining fracture will be increased, that is, the z-coordinate of the center is modified. This behavior can be overruled by setting the optional parameter 'ensure_realistic_cuts' to False.\n"

    "# T-intersections and tolerances\n",
    "Whether two lines are found to intersect in a T, X, or not at all depends on the tolerance used in geometric calculations. While this applies to most geometry computations in PorePy, there is a particular issue that may arise when working with outcrop data: When fractures are collected into a database, points in T-intersections are routinely snapped to the abutting fracture. In the decision to snap, a tolerance is applied, at least implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the extrusion model is invoked, it will identify T-intersections based on a user defined tolerance that may not be the same as in the snapping process. Moreover, it is not clear that the two tolerances mean the same. We have experienced some issues with what from the user side was considered T-intersections was treated as X-intersections by the extrusion module because of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this:\n",
    "1. Inspect the extruded fracture network, and see if you find the expected T-intersections.\n",
    "2. If necessary, redo the snapping with a tolerance sufficient to make extrusion behave well. The function snap_points_to_segments in the comp_geom model can be used for this.\n",
    "\n",

    "In addition to the basic features described above, the extrusion module has some more advanced features that go further towards creating more realistic networks. These are however also less tested. It is not clear whether the approach will ever create something resembling geological realism. Anyhow, the features are:\n",
    "1. Assign inclines to angles, so that they are not all vertical.\n",
    "2. Use family-based parameters, so that fractures that are grouped together (say, were created under the same geological regime) are assigned similar parameters, but different from other families."
