    "When Neumann type boundary conditions are specified, outflow values are considered positive, i.e. outward pointing normal vectors are assumed. For mechanics, this implies that a tensile force is positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Dirichlet boundary condition values for mechanics, we prescribe the displacement values directly, without regarding the normal vector. For a 2d  domain, this means that a prescribed boundary value of $\\mathbf{u}_b = [1, -2]$ signifies a unitary displacement to the right, and downwards with magnitude 2. This is regardless of which boundary it is assigned to.\n",

    "On inner boundaries, it is assumed that the mortar flux $\\lambda$ goes from the higher-dimensional to the lower-dimensional domain."

In 2d, it is the volume per area, and has dimensions [m$^3/$m$^2$] = [m]. For 1d intersection lines, the measure is a line measure. The specific volume thus has the dimensions [m$^3/$m] = [m$^2$]. In general, the dimensions are [m$^{3-d}$]. The full volume is always the product of the d-dimensional cell volume and the specific volume\n",
